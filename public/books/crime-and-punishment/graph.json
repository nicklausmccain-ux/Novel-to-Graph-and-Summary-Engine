Often adorned in modest but decidedly feminine attire, she embodies the practicality of a provincial landlady with an air of earnestness that masks deeper vulnerabilities. Her demeanor oscillates between maternal and manipulative; she possesses a keen instinct for social navigation and is at once solicitous and calculating. Praskovya's sharp tongue and relentless drive to maintain her authority are tempered by moments of genuine warmth, revealing a complex personality forged by the harsh realities of her social environment. Her actions, though often driven by self-interest, hint at a deeper longing for connection and respect, rendering her a poignant reflection of the struggles inherent in her society."
