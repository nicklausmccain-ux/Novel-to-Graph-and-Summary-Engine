  "story_summary": "Katerina Ivanovna organizes a dinner to honor Marmeladov's memory, spending much of the funeral money on it despite their poverty. She is determined to impress the lodgers and show her pride, but the dinner is poorly attended, with only a few unsavory guests arriving. Katerina's irritation grows as she interacts with her guests, particularly her landlady, Amalia Ivanovna, whom she feels is not properly acknowledging her efforts."
