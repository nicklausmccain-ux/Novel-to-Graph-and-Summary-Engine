  "story_summary": "Katerina Ivanovna pleads with Pyotr Petrovitch to protect her family, but he dismisses her, focusing instead on accusing Sonia of stealing a hundred-rouble note. As tension escalates, Sonia, terrified, insists she took nothing and offers back the ten-rouble note Luzhin had given her. Despite her protests, a folded hundred-rouble note is found in Sonia's pocket, leading to chaos as Katerina defends her."
