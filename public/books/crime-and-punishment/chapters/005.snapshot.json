His unkempt hair falls haphazardly over his forehead, accentuating his brooding demeanor. Often clad in worn clothing, he carries an air of dishevelment that mirrors his inner turmoil. Raskolnikov embodies a complex personality; he oscillates between arrogance and abject despair, grappling with his radical theories of morality and the weight of existential guilt.
