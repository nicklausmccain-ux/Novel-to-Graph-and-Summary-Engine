  "story_summary": "Raskolnikov, recovering from illness, gradually regains consciousness and interacts with Nastasya and a messenger from his office. Razumihin enters, revealing that Raskolnikov has been ill for days and has barely eaten. The messenger delivers a remittance of thirty-five roubles from Raskolnikov's mother, which he reluctantly signs for. As Raskolnikov begins to eat soup and drink tea, he observes the changes around him with a mix of astonishment and unease."
