  "story_summary": "Svidrigailov spent the evening visiting low haunts, where he interacted with Katia and some clerks before heading to a pleasure garden. After resolving a dispute over a stolen teaspoon, he returned home, drenched from a sudden storm. He visited Sonia, offering her bonds for her family and expressing concern for Rodion's fate. Afterward, he made an unexpected visit to his betrothed's parents, gifting her a substantial sum of money before leaving."
