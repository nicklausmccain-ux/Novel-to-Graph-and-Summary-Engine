His unkempt hair falls haphazardly over his forehead, accentuating his brooding demeanor. Often clad in worn clothing, he carries an air of dishevelment that mirrors his inner turmoil. Raskolnikov embodies a complex personality; he oscillates between arrogance and abject despair, grappling with his radical theories of morality and the weight of existential guilt. His sharp, penetrating gaze reveals a mind in turmoil, constantly at odds with itself, as he wrestles with profound philosophical questions that alienate him from society while simultaneously fueling his desperate search for redemption.",

Often adorned in modest but decidedly feminine attire, she embodies the practicality of a provincial landlady with an air of earnestness that masks deeper vulnerabilities. Her demeanor oscillates between maternal and manipulative; she possesses a keen instinct for social navigation and is at once solicitous and calculating. Praskovya's sharp tongue and relentless drive to maintain her authority are tempered by moments of genuine warmth, revealing a complex personality forged by the harsh realities of her social environment. Her actions, though often driven by self-interest, hint at a deeper longing for connection and respect, rendering her a poignant reflection of the struggles inherent in her society.",

His sharp, intelligent eyes, often clouded with a intense and feverish light, reveal a mind teetering on the brink of madness and philosophical existentialism. Clad in tattered clothing that matches his impoverished state, he often exudes an air of dishevelment and neglect. Raskolnikov's demeanor oscillates between brooding introspection and restless agitation, reflecting his complex nature and moral dilemmas. Beneath his gloomy exterior, there lies a fervent, albeit distorted, idealism that seeks to transcend conventional morality, marking him as a tragic figure ensnared in the throes of his own radical thoughts and guilt.",

He carries himself with an uneasy fidget, betraying a deeply insecure nature, while his attire—a somewhat shabby suit that seems ill-fitted—underscores his socially awkward demeanor. Luzhin's personality is marked by a blend of cunning intelligence and an unsettling sense of entitlement; he exudes a calculating charm, often trying to assert his superiority over others, which only amplifies his insecurities when met with resistance. His obsession with status and material wealth further reveals his superficial values, making him a compelling, if not deeply flawed, character in the narrative.",

Porfiry often appears dressed in a simple yet tidy manner, exuding a sense of understated authority and a meticulous nature. His demeanor is characterized by a blend of playfulness and seriousness, enabling him to navigate tense conversations with a subtle wit that disarms his subjects. This combination of shrewdness and empathy makes him a formidable adversary for Raskolnikov, as he artfully balances the roles of both confidant and challenger, drawing out confessions with an almost hypnotic patience.",

Their brief interaction occurs when the drunken man shouts at Raskolnikov, referring to him as a 'German hatter', hinting at the societal disdain that Raskolnikov grapples with. The encounter captures a moment of alienation, underscored by Raskolnikov’s dark musings about the pallor of passers-by and the haunting memories of his grandmother.

As Raskolnikov grapples with his deteriorating circumstances, he contemplates murder, believing Alyona's life holds little value in comparison to the greater good he envisions for society. This culminates in a violent act where he kills Alyona with her own axe, a grim marker of his moral degradation.
