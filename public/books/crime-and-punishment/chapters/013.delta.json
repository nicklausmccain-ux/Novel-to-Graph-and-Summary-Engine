  "story_summary": "Raskolnikov, feeling a sudden calmness, dresses in new clothes and leaves his apartment with twenty-five roubles in his pocket. He wanders the streets, reflecting on his desire for change and the need to end his current state of existence. As he walks, he interacts with various people, including a group of women near a saloon, and contemplates his surroundings while searching for something he cannot quite define."
