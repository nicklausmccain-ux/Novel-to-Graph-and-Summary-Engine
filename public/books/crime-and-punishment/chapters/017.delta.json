  "story_summary": "Raskolnikov's mother and sister visit him, and he appears almost recovered, though still pale and troubled. Zossimov, the doctor, expresses optimism about Raskolnikov's condition, while Raskolnikov struggles with feelings of guilt and confusion regarding his recent actions. He awkwardly reconciles with his sister, Dounia, and reveals that he gave away money meant for his family to a widow. The atmosphere is tense, as Raskolnikov senses his family's unease around him."
