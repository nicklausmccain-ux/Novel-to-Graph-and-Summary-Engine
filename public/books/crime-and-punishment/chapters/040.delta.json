  "story_summary": "Raskolnikov, now a convict in Siberia, reflects on his trial and confession, which revealed his clear and detailed account of the murders he committed. Despite his admission of guilt and the circumstances surrounding his mental state, he receives a relatively lenient sentence of eight years of penal servitude. Meanwhile, his family, particularly his mother Pulcheria and sister Dounia, cope with his absence and her declining health, while Razumihin vows to support them and plans for a future together."
