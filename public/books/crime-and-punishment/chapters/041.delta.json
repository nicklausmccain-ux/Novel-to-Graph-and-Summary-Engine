  "story_summary": "Raskolnikov reflects on his time in prison, feeling a mix of shame and pride about his circumstances. He grapples with his lack of repentance for his crime and observes the contrasting attitudes of his fellow prisoners towards life. Despite his isolation and the disdain he faces, he notices how they cherish life, especially in the face of suffering. Sonia visits him infrequently, yet her presence lingers in his thoughts."
