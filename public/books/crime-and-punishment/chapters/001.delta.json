  "story_summary": "On a hot July evening, a young man named Raskolnikov leaves his cramped garret in St. Petersburg, feeling anxious and ashamed due to his debts to his landlady. He reflects on his isolation and fears while navigating the streets, overwhelmed by the heat and the stench of the city. Eventually, he arrives at the home of an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to pawn a watch, hoping to receive a small sum of money."
