  "story_summary": "Dounia expresses her regret over her previous engagement to Luzhin, feeling tempted by his money but unaware of his true nature. Raskolnikov informs her of Svidrigailov's offer of ten thousand roubles, which Pulcheria Alexandrovna vehemently opposes. Razumihin, excited by the prospect of a new business venture, proposes a partnership in publishing, which Dounia finds appealing, while Raskolnikov remains skeptical."
