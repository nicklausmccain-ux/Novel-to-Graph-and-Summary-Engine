Nastasya, the servant, brings him tea and informs him that his landlady is considering involving the police due to his unpaid rent. After a brief conversation, she mentions a letter has arrived for him, which excites Raskolnikov. When he receives the letter from his mother, he is overwhelmed with emotions and hesitates to open it."
