  "story_summary": "Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov timidly enters Raskolnikov's room, surprising everyone. Raskolnikov, recognizing her as the daughter of the man who died the previous day, invites her to sit and discusses the funeral arrangements. Sonia nervously conveys Katerina Ivanovna's request for Raskolnikov to attend the service and the funeral lunch. As they talk, Raskolnikov expresses concern for his father's watch and other belongings he has pawned."
